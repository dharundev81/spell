                        It is common knowledge that Engish is the most widely spoken official language in the world. It is also the main language used in international affairs and is indisputably the primary language of global trade and commerce.</p>

                        So, when a student graduates, hs/her vocational intelligence alone will not do. Vocational intelligence must be complemented by verbal intelligence. The students who are being churned out from colleges and universities of our country are not entirely equipped to face the global competition prevailing today in terms of communicative competence. Laying a strong foundation at the school level for raising a towering edifice of career has become the need of the hour.
